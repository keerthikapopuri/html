<ul>  
 <li>The R.V.R. & J.C. College of Engineering introduced the undergraduate program in Computer Science & Engineering (CSE) in 1994. Since its inception, the department has grown exponentially in the areas of student intake, quality of academic work and student achievements. The initial student enrollment was 30. Since then, the B.Tech programme has seen a gradual increase in the student enrollment, and current annual intake stands at 180. Taking the needs of the academic institutions and the industry into cognizance, the department of CSE started M.Tech programme in the year 2003. The current annual intake for the M.Tech programme is 18. This programme helps to enhance the quality of the academic atmosphere in the department.</li>  
 <li>The department has excellent infrastructure to support the teaching learning process. More than half of the class rooms of the department have the integrated computer-assisted teaching systems. The faculty of the department utilizes these systems to deliver lectures effectively. A new training facility named E-class room was developed in the year 2009. The E-class room is one of a kind training facility capable of hosting 75 participants at a time and has one dedicated computer terminal for each participant. The latest equipment required for video conferencing and remote lecture delivery are available in the E-class room. The department of CSE also maintains the MOODLE, the learning management system for electronic distribution of lecture material, online references and question papers. The learning management system, MOODLE is also being used by the faculty members to conduct online examinations.</li>  
 <li>The department has modern laboratories to serve the teaching and research needs of the students and faculty members. The laboratories of the department have substantial computing resources that include the latest hardware and software. The laboratories are equipped with the computers of latest configuration procured from MNCs. All the laboratory computers are connected to the campus network using hi-speed Fiber Optic Local Area Network. A dedicated leased line provides round-the clock Internet access to all the laboratory computers. The department also maintains a dedicated lab for improving the communication skills of the students.</li>  
 <li>The college and the department are well served by the central library. The central library has more than 5000 titles related to Computer Science and Engineering discipline. The central library has online subscription to various e-journals and INDEST (Indian National Digital Library in Engineering Science and Technology) consortium. The subscription provides online access to reputed engineering journals from professional societies like IEEE, ASME, ASCE, SPRINGER, ELSEVIER etc. There is also a dedicated department library to serve the needs of the department.</li>  
</ul>  
<p>The department is well supported in academics by qualified and experienced faculty including six doctorates. The faculty members of the department actively pursue research in their respective areas and publish research papers in renowned journals. The students are encouraged to participate in national and international conferences, workshops, student symposiums and to publish papers in national / international journals.</p>
<p>The department strives towards delivering quality education to the students. This fact is attested to by the National Board of Accreditation (NBA). The department of CSE received accreditation from NBA for 5 times during 2002, 2007, 2012, 2017 and 2021. The department invites experts from premiere educational institutions and the industry to conduct seminars / workshops on the advanced topics in Computer Science.</p>
