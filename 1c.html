         <h1>About</h1>
         <p>Established by the renowned Nagarjuna Education Society (1967) in the year 1985, the College drew its initial impetus from people's representatives, local doctors, charitable trusts and commercial houses of Guntur District..</p><p>The home page should be an introduction to the purpose of your site.</p><p>Today, it enjoys flagship status among the eight constituent institutions that are governed by Nagarjuna Education Society.The founder-members of Nagarjuna Education Society and their successors have provided abundant inputs to turn a mere 3 programmes -180-intake College into a 16 programmes -1428 - intake by the 2020. The premier status of the institution is made possible by sticking to our core-principles of student-focus, Human Resource Development and emphasis on total quality.</p>

         <h1>Infrastructural Abundance</h1>
         <p>It is part of the basic policy of the promoters that infrastructural self-sufficiency is a pre-requisite for better productivity and performance in all the activities, more so for academic activities. The Management has always been creating and updating academic and building infrastructure to meet the AICTE norms and standards from time to time and to make life easy and stress-free in the campus.
The 25-bus exclusive transport saves the students and staff from the vagaries of public transport. A highly subsidized Canteen that serves lunch and stacks, a Dispensary, Bank, a Gymnasium to provide fitness regimen are a few amenities. Four A.C Seminar Halls, an Auditorium, an Open-air Theatre are the venues for co-curricular and extra-curricular events, that make life colourful and enjoyable. Perhaps, there is every facility in the campus that renowned institutes generally provide to its staff and students.
